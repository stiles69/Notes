	We have installed ArcoLinux and rebooted. We selected to autologin so we end up in the Xfce desktop environment.



	We will explain that one first. We recommend you read this “Need to know” page as it will contain all future versions
	and future faq.



	We will show you how to fix the icons so they ALL follow the Sardi Mono Colora theme. Everytime there is a new update
	of these 6 applications the icon (or more) will be broken again. You need to rerun the script.



	1 sudo hardcode-fixer



	We can move the plank to the top or bottom and change the look.



	Variety can help you to change the wallpaper.



	Xfce settings manager is shown.



	We activate conky’s.



	Set your own preferences.

			INSTALL NEMO AS EXTRA FILEMANAGER ON ANY ARCOLINUX WITH MANY TIPS
			Installing nemo is quite simple.



			1 sudo pacman -S nemo
			Then you set nemo as the default application via “exo-preferred-application” or via the menu “Preferred
			Applications“.
			Deleting thunar completely might break your system. I have not tried yet. We see in the video that there are
			dependancies. They should be deleted as well…
			I suggest leaving thunar but use nemo instead as the best option.
			Correction: you do not have the complete cinnamon desktop. You can not login.



			Solution 1
			Nemo expects gnome-terminal to be installed so install it with
			sudo pacman -S gnome-terminal
			Tip : there is also a transparent gnome-terminal called “gnome-terminal-transparency”



			Solution 2
			We want the standard terminal “Termite” on Nemo.
			We found the solution on the wiki of Arch Linux at <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Nemohttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Nemohttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Nemo"
