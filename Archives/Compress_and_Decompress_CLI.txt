Compress and Decompress CLI


Created Sunday 07 January 2018



Compressing files under Linux or UNIX cheat sheet
Both Linux and UNIX include various commands for Compressing and decompresses (read as expand compressed file). To
compress files you can use gzip, bzip2 and zip commands. To expand compressed file (decompresses) you can use and
gzip -d, bunzip2 (bzip2 -d), unzip commands.

    Syntax
    Description
    Example(s)
  
  
    gzip {filename}
    Gzip compress the size of the given files using Lempel-Ziv coding (LZ77). Whenever possible, each
      file is replaced by one with the extension .gz.
    gzip mydata.doc
  
  
    gzip *.jpg
  
    ls -l
  
  
    bzip2 {filename}
    bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block sorting text compression algorithm, and
      Huffman coding. Compression is generally considerably better than that achieved by bzip command (LZ77/LZ78-based
      compressors). Whenever possible, each file is replaced by one with the extension .bz2.
    bzip2 mydata.doc
  
  
    bzip2 *.jpg
  
    ls -l
  
  
    zip {.zip-filename} {filename-to-compress}
    zip is a compression and file packaging utility for Unix/Linux. Each file is stored in single .zip
      {.zip-filename} file with the extension .zip.
    zip mydata.zip mydata.doc
  
  
    tar -zcvf {.tgz-file} {files}
  
  
  
  
    zip data.zip *.doc
  
    ls -l
  
  
    tar -jcvf {.tbz2-file} {files}
    The GNU tar is archiving utility but it can be use to compressing large file(s). GNU tar supports
      both archive compressing through gzip and bzip2. If you have more than 2 files then it is recommended to use tar
      instead of gzip or bzip2.
    tar -zcvf data.tgz *.doc
  
  
    -z: use gzip compress
  
  
  
  
    -j: use bzip2 compress
  
  
  
  
    tar -zcvf pics.tar.gz *.jpg *.png
    tar -jcvf data.tbz2 *.doc
    ls -l
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
    Decompressing files
  
  
  
  
    Syntax
    Description
    Example(s)
  
  
    gzip -d {.gz file} gunzip {.gz file}
    Decompressed a file that is created using gzip command. File is restored to their original form
      using this command.
    gzip -d mydata.doc.gz gunzip mydata.doc.gz
  
  
    bzip2 -d {.bz2-file} bunzip2 {.bz2-file}
    Decompressed a file that is created using bzip2 command. File is restored to their original form
      using this command.
    bzip2 -d mydata.doc.bz2 gunzip mydata.doc.bz2
  
  
    unzip {.zip file}
    Extract compressed files in a ZIP archive.
  
  
  
    tar -zxvf {.tgz-file}
      tar -jxvf {.tbz2-file}
    Untar or decompressed a file(s) that is created using tar compressing through gzip and bzip2
      filter
    tar -zxvf data.tgz tar -zxvf pics.tar.gz *.jpg tar -jxvf data.tbz2
