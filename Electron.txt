Electron


Created Monday 06 August 2018



Installation
To install prebuilt Electron binaries, use npm. The preferred method is to install Electron as a development
dependency in your app:



npm install electron --save-dev --save-exact</b>
The --save-exact flag is recommended as Electron does not follow semantic versioning. For info on how to manage
Electron versions in your apps, see Electron versioning.



For more installation options and troubleshooting tips, see installation.



Clone and run the electron/electron-quick-start repository to see a minimal Electron app in action:



git clone https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start</b>
cd electron-quick-start</b>
npm install</b>
npm start</b>



Programmatic usage
Most people use Electron from the command line, but if you require electron inside your Node app (not your Electron
app) it will return the file path to the binary. Use this to spawn Electron from Node scripts:



const electron = require('electron')</b>
const proc = require('child_process')</b>



// will print something similar to /Users/maf/.../Electron</b>
console.log(electron)</b>



// spawn Electron</b>
const child = proc.spawn(electron)</b>
