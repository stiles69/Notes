NAME
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
  crontab - maintains crontab files for individual users




  SYNOPSIS
  <div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
    crontab [-u user] file
    crontab [-u user] [-l | -r | -e] [-i] [-s]
    crontab -n [ hostname ]
    crontab -c




    DESCRIPTION
    <div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
      Crontab is the program used to install a crontab table file, remove or list the existing
      tables used to serve the cron(8) daemon. Each user can have their own crontab, and though
      these are files in /var/spool/, they are not intended to be edited directly. For SELinux
      in MLS mode, you can define more crontabs for each range. For more information, see
      selinux(8).




      <div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
        In this version of Cron it is possible to use a network-mounted shared /var/spool/cron
        across a cluster of hosts and specify that only one of the hosts should run the crontab
        jobs in the particular directory at any one time. You may also use crontab(1) from any of
        these hosts to edit the same shared set of crontab files, and to set and query which host
        should run the crontab jobs.




        <div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
          Running cron jobs can be allowed or disallowed for different users. For this purpose, use
          the cron.allow and cron.deny files. If the cron.allow file exists, a user must be listed
          in it to be allowed to use cron If the cron.allow file does not exist but the cron.deny
          file does exist, then a user must not be listed in the cron.deny file in order to use
          cron. If neither of these files exists, only the super user is allowed to use cron.
          Another way to restrict access to cron is to use PAM authentication in /etc/secu‐
          rity/access.conf to set up users, which are allowed or disallowed to use crontab or modify
          system cron jobs in the /etc/cron.d/ directory.




          <div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
            The temporary directory can be set in an environment variable. If it is not set by the
            user, the /tmp directory is used.




            OPTIONS
            <div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
              -u Appends the name of the user whose crontab is to be modified. If this option is

              <div style='padding-left: 90pt'>
                not used, crontab examines "your" crontab, i.e., the crontab of the person execut‐
                ing the command. Note that su(8) may confuse crontab, thus, when executing com‐
                mands under su(8) you should always use the -u option. If no crontab exists for a
                particular user, it is created for him the first time the crontab -u command is
                used under his username.




                <div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
                  -l Displays the current crontab on standard output.




                  <div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
                    -r Removes the current crontab.




                    <div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
                      -e Edits the current crontab using the editor specified by the VISUAL or EDITOR envi‐

                      <div style='padding-left: 90pt'>
                        ronment variables. After you exit from the editor, the modified crontab will be
                        installed automatically.




                        <div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
                          -i This option modifies the -r option to prompt the user for a 'y/Y' response before

                          <div style='padding-left: 90pt'>
                            actually removing the crontab.




                            <div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
                              -s Appends the current SELinux security context string as an MLS_LEVEL setting to the

                              <div style='padding-left: 90pt'>
                                crontab file before editing / replacement occurs - see the documentation of
                                MLS_LEVEL in crontab(5).




                                <div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
                                  -n This option is relevant only if cron(8) was started with the -c option, to enable

                                    clustering support. It is used to set the host in the cluster which should run the
                                    jobs specified in the crontab files in the /var/spool/cron directory. If a host‐
                                    name is supplied, the host whose hostname returned by gethostname(2) matches the
                                    supplied hostname, will be selected to run the selected cron jobs subsequently. If
                                    there is no host in the cluster matching the supplied hostname, or you explicitly
                                    specify an empty hostname, then the selected jobs will not be run at all. If the
                                    hostname is omitted, the name of the local host returned by gethostname(2) is used.
                                    Using this option has no effect on the /etc/crontab file and the files in the
                                    /etc/cron.d directory, which are always run, and considered host-specific. For
                                    more information on clustering support, see cron(8).

                                      -c This option is only relevant if cron(8) was started with the -c option, to
                                      enable

                                        clustering support. It is used to query which host in the cluster is currently
                                        set
                                        to run the jobs specified in the crontab files in the directory /var/spool/cron
                                        ,
                                        as set using the -n option.

                                              The crontab command conforms to IEEE Std1003.2-1992 (``POSIX''). This new
                                              command syntax
                                              differs from previous versions of Vixie Cron, as well as from the classic
                                              SVR3 syntax.
